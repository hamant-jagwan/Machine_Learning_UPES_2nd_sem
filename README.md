# Applied Machine Learning Lab
## List of Experiments
    Below is a list of small machine learning-based projects suitable for this lab work.
    Through these projects students are expected to implement the concepts of data
    preprocessing and machine learning algorithms. These projects cover various
    machine learning techniques and can serve as valuable learning experiences:
### Experiment 1 
    Predicting Housing Prices: Develop a regression model to predict
    house prices based on features like location, size, and amenities.
### Experiment 2 
    Iris Flower Classification: Use the Iris dataset to build a
    classification model that predicts the species of iris flowers.
### Experiment 3 
    Handwritten Digit Recognition: Implement a digit recognition
    system using the MNIST dataset and a neural network.
### Experiment 4 
    Breast Cancer Diagnosis: Develop a breast cancer classification
    model using medical imaging data (e.g., mammograms).
### Experiment 5 
    Sentiment Analysis: Create a sentiment analysis tool that
    classifies text reviews as positive or negative using natural language processing
    (NLP) techniques.
### Experiment 6 
    Spam Email Detection: Build a spam email filter using text
    classification algorithms.
### Experiment 7 
    Predicting Stock Prices: Develop a time series prediction model
    to forecast stock prices.
